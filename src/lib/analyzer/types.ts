/**
 * F005 - Ingredient Analysis Engine Types
 *
 * Pre-implementation thinking:
 * 1. What does this feature do? Match extracted ingredients against knowledge base,
 *    calculate an overall grade (A-F), and flag each ingredient red/yellow/green.
 * 2. Key design decisions:
 *    - Grade uses a 100-point scoring system mapped to A-F letters
 *    - Position in ingredient list matters (first = most abundant = more weight)
 *    - Unknown ingredients get a neutral "unknown" flag (gray in UI)
 * 3. What could go wrong? Empty ingredient lists, all unknown ingredients, OCR garbage
 * 4. Simplest approach: point deduction system with position weighting
 * 5. Acceptance criteria: correct grading for known good/bad foods, handles edge cases
